## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ltbatis/pyssword.git
cd pyssword
pip install requirements.txt
```

---
## Testing
```
python test_password_generator.py
```

## Usage
Here are some demonstrations of how you can generate passwords using `pyssword`:
1. Default Password (Medium Complexity, 8 Characters):
```
python main.py
```
2. Setting Password Length:
```
python main.py -l 12
```
3. Avoid Digits:
```
python main.py --no-digits
```
4. Avoid Special Characters:
```
python main.py --no-special
```
5. Complexity Levels:
- Low:
    ```
    python main.py -c low
    ```
- Medium:
    ```
    python main.py -c medium
    ```
- High:
    ```
    python main.py -c high
    ```
6. Avoid Similar-Looking Characters:
```
python main.py --avoid-similar
```
7. Pronounceable:
```
python main.py --pronounceable
```
8. Keyword usage:
```
python main.py --keyword Beauty
```
9. Combination of Options:
```
python main.py -l 16 -c high --no-special --avoid-similar
```

## Future Improvements

- [x] **Pronounceable Words**: We're planning to add a feature to generate passwords that are sequences of pronounceable words, making them easier to memorize.
  - **English**: âœ… Completed
  - **Portuguese**: ðŸ”„ In progress... (10% done)
  - **Spanish**: ðŸš« Not started yet
  - **French**: ðŸš« Not started yet
  - **Italian**: ðŸš« Not started yet
- [ ] **Password Generation History**: Save the most recently generated passwords in a history (possibly stored locally) so users can revisit previously generated passwords if they lose them.
- [x] **Password Strength Assessment**: Evaluate and report how strong the generated password is, using criteria such as length, character variety, and common patterns.
  - **Basic Evaluation**: âœ… Completed
  - **Advanced Evaluation with Patterns**: ðŸš« Not started yet
- [ ] **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copy the generated password to the clipboard.
- [ ] **Password Expiry**: Set a date or time period after which the generated password will be considered invalid.
- [ ] **Specific Character Inclusion/Exclusion**: Allow users to specifically include or exclude certain characters or sets of characters.
- [ ] **Safe Digraphs or Trigraphs**: Instead of picking characters entirely at random, choose pairs or trios of characters that are easier to type together.
- [ ] **Password Variations**: Create variations of a generated password for sites or apps that have specific requirements.
- [ ] **Password Masking**: Allow users to set a "mask" for the password, like "aA#aA#".
- [ ] **Save in Password Managers**: Integration with popular password managers to directly save the generated password.
- [x] **Keyword-based Password**: Generate a password based on a keyword provided by the user, but modify it to meet certain security criteria.
- [ ] **API/Web Service**: Turn your tool into an online service where other applications can generate passwords via API calls.
- [ ] **Graphical UI**: Create a simple graphical interface for the generator for those who don't want to use the command line.
- [ ] **Multi-language**: As mentioned earlier, support for generating pronounceable passwords in different languages.
